# Ollama Swift Client

A Swift client library for interacting with the
[Ollama API](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/api.md).

## Requirements

- Swift 5.7+
- macOS 13+
- [Ollama](https://ollama.com)

## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

Add the following to your `Package.swift` file:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/mattt/ollama-swift.git", from: "1.8.0")
```

## Usage

> [!NOTE]
> The tests and example code for this library use the
> [llama3.2](https://ollama.com/library/llama3.2) model.
> Run the following command to download the model to run them yourself:
>
> ```
> ollama pull llama3.2
> ```

### Initializing the client

```swift
import Ollama

// Use the default client (http://localhost:11434)
let client = Client.default

// Or create a custom client
let customClient = Client(host: URL(string: "http://your-ollama-host:11434")!, userAgent: "MyApp/1.0")
```

### Generating text

Generate text using a specified model:

```swift
do {
    let response = try await client.generate(
        model: "llama3.2",
        prompt: "Tell me a joke about Swift programming.",
        options: [
            "temperature": 0.7,
            "max_tokens": 100
        ],
        keepAlive: .minutes(10)  // Keep model loaded for 10 minutes
    )
    print(response.response)
} catch {
    print("Error: \(error)")
}
```

#### Streaming text generation

Generate text in a streaming fashion to receive responses in real-time:

```swift
do {
    let stream = try await client.generateStream(
        model: "llama3.2",
        prompt: "Tell me a joke about Swift programming.",
        options: [
            "temperature": 0.7,
            "max_tokens": 100
        ]
    )

    var fullResponse = ""
    for try await chunk in stream {
        // Process each chunk of the response as it arrives
        print(chunk.response, terminator: "")
        fullResponse += chunk.response
    }
    print("\nFull response: \(fullResponse)")
} catch {
    print("Error: \(error)")
}
```

### Chatting with a model

Generate a chat completion:

```swift
do {
    let response = try await client.chat(
        model: "llama3.2",
        messages: [
            .system("You are a helpful assistant."),
            .user("In which city is Apple Inc. located?")
        ],
        keepAlive: .minutes(10)  // Keep model loaded for 10 minutes
    )
    print(response.message.content)
} catch {
    print("Error: \(error)")
}
```

#### Streaming chat responses

Stream chat responses to get real-time partial completions:

```swift
do {
    let stream = try await client.chatStream(
        model: "llama3.2",
        messages: [
            .system("You are a helpful assistant."),
            .user("Write a short poem about Swift programming.")
        ]
    )

    var fullContent = ""
    for try await chunk in stream {
        // Process each chunk of the message as it arrives
        if let content = chunk.message.content {
            print(content, terminator: "")
            fullContent += content
        }
    }
    print("\nComplete poem: \(fullContent)")
} catch {
    print("Error: \(error)")
}
```

You can also stream chat responses when using tools:

```swift
do {
    let stream = try await client.chatStream(
        model: "llama3.2",
        messages: [
            .system("You are a helpful assistant that can check the weather."),
            .user("What's the weather like in Portland?")
        ],
        tools: [weatherTool]
    )

    for try await chunk in stream {
        // Check if the model is making tool calls
        if let toolCalls = chunk.message.toolCalls, !toolCalls.isEmpty {
            print("Model is requesting tool: \(toolCalls[0].function.name)")
        }

        // Print content from the message as it streams
        if let content = chunk.message.content {
            print(content, terminator: "")
        }

        // Check if this is the final chunk
        if chunk.done {
            print("\nResponse complete")
        }
    }
} catch {
    print("Error: \(error)")
}
```

### Using Structured Outputs

You can request structured outputs from models by specifying a format.
Pass `"json"` to get back a JSON string,
or specify a full [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org):

```swift
// Simple JSON format
let response = try await client.chat(
    model: "llama3.2",
    messages: [.user("List 3 colors.")],
    format: "json"
)

// Using JSON schema for more control
let schema: Value = [
    "type": "object",
    "properties": [
        "colors": [
            "type": "array",
            "items": [
                "type": "object",
                "properties": [
                    "name": ["type": "string"],
                    "hex": ["type": "string"]
                ],
                "required": ["name", "hex"]
            ]
        ]
    ],
    "required": ["colors"]
]

let response = try await client.chat(
    model: "llama3.2",
    messages: [.user("List 3 colors with their hex codes.")],
    format: schema
)

// The response will be a JSON object matching the schema:
// {
//   "colors": [
//     {"name": "papayawhip", "hex": "#FFEFD5"},
//     {"name": "indigo", "hex": "#4B0082"},
//     {"name": "navy", "hex": "#000080"}
//   ]
// }
```

The format parameter works with both `chat` and `generate` methods.

### Using Thinking Models

Some models support a "thinking" mode
where they show their reasoning process before providing the final answer.
This is particularly useful for complex reasoning tasks.

```swift
// Generate with thinking enabled
let response = try await client.generate(
    model: "deepseek-r1:8b",
    prompt: "What is 17 * 23? Show your work.",
    think: true
)

print("Thinking: \(response.thinking ?? "None")")
print("Answer: \(response.response)")
```

You can also use thinking in chat conversations:

```swift
let response = try await client.chat(
    model: "deepseek-r1:8b",
    messages: [
        .system("You are a helpful mathematician."),
        .user("Calculate 9.9 + 9.11 and explain your reasoning.")
    ],
    think: true
)

print("Thinking: \(response.message.thinking ?? "None")")
print("Response: \(response.message.content)")
```

> [!TIP]
> You can check which models support thinking by examining their capabilities:
> ```swift
> let modelInfo = try await client.showModel("deepseek-r1:8b")
> if modelInfo.capabilities.contains(.thinking) {
>     print("🧠 This model supports thinking!")
> }
> ```

### Managing Model Memory with Keep-Alive

You can control how long a model stays loaded in memory using the `keepAlive` parameter. This is useful for managing memory usage and response times.

```swift
// Use server default (typically 5 minutes)
let response = try await client.generate(
    model: "llama3.2",
    prompt: "Hello!"
    // keepAlive defaults to .default
)

// Keep model loaded for 10 minutes
let response = try await client.generate(
    model: "llama3.2",
    prompt: "Hello!",
    keepAlive: .minutes(10)
)

// Keep model loaded for 2 hours
let response = try await client.chat(
    model: "llama3.2",
    messages: [.user("Hello!")],
    keepAlive: .hours(2)
)

// Keep model loaded for 30 seconds
let response = try await client.generate(
    model: "llama3.2",
    prompt: "Hello!",
    keepAlive: .seconds(30)
)

// Keep model loaded indefinitely
let response = try await client.chat(
    model: "llama3.2",
    messages: [.user("Hello!")],
    keepAlive: .forever
)

// Unload model immediately after response
let response = try await client.generate(
    model: "llama3.2",
    prompt: "Hello!",
    keepAlive: .none
)
```

- **`.default`** - Use the server's default keep-alive behavior (default if not specified)
- **`.none`** - Unload immediately after the request
- **`.seconds(Int)`** - Keep loaded for the specified number of seconds
- **`.minutes(Int)`** - Keep loaded for the specified number of minutes
- **`.hours(Int)`** - Keep loaded for the specified number of hours
- **`.forever`** - Keep loaded indefinitely

> [!NOTE]
> Zero durations (e.g., `.seconds(0)`) are treated as `.none` (unload immediately).
> Negative durations are treated as `.forever` (keep loaded indefinitely).

### Using Tools

Ollama supports tool calling with models,
allowing models to perform complex tasks or interact with external services.

> [!NOTE]
> Tool support requires a [compatible model](https://ollama.com/search?c=tools),
> such as llama3.2.

#### Creating a Tool

Define a tool by specifying its name, description, parameters, and implementation:

```swift
struct WeatherInput: Codable {
    let city: String
}

struct WeatherOutput: Codable {
    let temperature: Double
    let conditions: String
}

let weatherTool = Tool<WeatherInput, WeatherOutput>(
    name: "get_current_weather",
    description: """
    Get the current weather for a city,
    with conditions ("sunny", "cloudy", etc.)
    and temperature in °C.
    """,
    parameters: [
        "city": [
            "type": "string",
            "description": "The city to get weather for"
        ]
    ],
    required: ["city"]
) { input async throws -> WeatherOutput in
    // Implement weather lookup logic here
    return WeatherOutput(temperature: 18.5, conditions: "cloudy")
}
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In version 1.3.0 and later,
> the `parameters` argument should contain only the properties object,
> not the full JSON schema of the tool.
>
> For backward compatibility,
> passing a full schema in the `parameters` argument
> (with `"type"`, `"properties"`, and `"required"` fields)
> is still supported but deprecated and will emit a warning in debug builds.

>         "required": ["city"]
>     ]
> ) { /* implementation */ }
> ```

#### Using Tools in Chat

Provide tools to the model during chat:

```swift
let messages: [Chat.Message] = [
    .system("You are a helpful assistant that can check the weather."),
    .user("What's the weather like in Portland?")
]

let response = try await client.chat(
    model: "llama3.1",
    messages: messages,
    tools: [weatherTool]
)

// Handle tool calls in the response
if let toolCalls = response.message.toolCalls {
    for toolCall in toolCalls {
        print("Tool called: \(toolCall.function.name)")
        print("Arguments: \(toolCall.function.arguments)")
    }
}
```

#### Multi-turn Tool Conversations

Tools can be used in multi-turn conversations, where the model can use tool results to provide more detailed responses:

```swift
var messages: [Chat.Message] = [
    .system("You are a helpful assistant that can convert colors."),
    .user("What's the hex code for yellow?")
]

// First turn - model calls the tool
let response1 = try await client.chat(
    model: "llama3.1",
    messages: messages,
    tools: [rgbToHexTool]
)

enum ToolError {
    case invalidParameters
}

// Add tool response to conversation
if let toolCall = response1.message.toolCalls?.first {
    // Parse the tool arguments
    guard let args = toolCall.function.arguments,
          let redValue = args["red"],
          let greenValue = args["green"],
          let blueValue = args["blue"],
          let red = Double(redValue, strict: false),
          let green = Double(greenValue, strict: false),
          let blue = Double(blueValue, strict: false)
    else {
        throw ToolError.invalidParameters
    }

    let input = HexColorInput(
        red: red,
        green: green,
        blue: blue
    )

    // Execute the tool with the input
    let hexColor = try await rgbToHexTool(input)

    // Add the tool result to the conversation
    messages.append(.tool(hexColor))
}

// Continue conversation with tool result
messages.append(.user("What other colors are similar?"))
let response2 = try await client.chat(
    model: "llama3.1",
    messages: messages,
    tools: [rgbToHexTool]
)
```

### Generating embeddings

Generate embeddings for a given text:

```swift
do {
    let response = try await client.embed(
        model: "llama3.2",
        input: "Here is an article about llamas..."
    )
    print("Embeddings: \(response.embeddings)")
} catch {
    print("Error: \(error)")
}
```

Generate embeddings for multiple texts in a single batch:

```swift
do {
    let texts = [
        "First article about llamas...",
        "Second article about alpacas...",
        "Third article about vicuñas..."
    ]

    let response = try await client.embed(
        model: "llama3.2",
        inputs: texts
    )

    // Access embeddings for each input
    for (index, embedding) in response.embeddings.rawValue.enumerated() {
        print("Embedding \(index): \(embedding.count) dimensions")
    }
} catch {
    print("Error: \(error)")
}
```

### Managing models

#### Listing models

List available models:

```swift
do {
    let models = try await client.listModels()
    for model in models {
        print("Model: \(model.name), Modified: \(model.modifiedAt)")
    }
} catch {
    print("Error: \(error)")
}
```

#### Retrieving model information

Get detailed information about a specific model:

```swift
do {
    let modelInfo = try await client.showModel("llama3.2")
    print("Modelfile: \(modelInfo.modelfile)")
    print("Parameters: \(modelInfo.parameters)")
    print("Template: \(modelInfo.template)")
} catch {
    print("Error: \(error)")
}
```

#### Pulling a model

Download a model from the Ollama library:

```swift
do {
    let success = try await client.pullModel("llama3.2")
    if success {
        print("Model successfully pulled")
    } else {
        print("Failed to pull model")
    }
} catch {
    print("Error: \(error)")
}
```

#### Pushing a model

```swift
do {
    let success = try await client.pushModel("mynamespace/mymodel:latest")
    if success {
        print("Model successfully pushed")
    } else {
        print("Failed to push model")
    }
} catch {
    print("Error: \(error)")
}
```
